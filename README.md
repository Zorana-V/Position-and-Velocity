# Position-and-Velocity
Input the initial position and velocity of the spacecraft, inital time of the simulation, 
the final time of the simulation and the number of time intervals desired in the simulation.

The output will be a table of position and velocity broken down in 3D Cartesian coordiates,
a plot of the position of the spacecraft with a coresponding velocity vector for each data point,
and a plot of the position of the spacecraft found by propogating the orbit on a circle compared
to the position of the spacecraft found by using ODE113 (a MATLAB function used to integrate
the system of differential equations).
